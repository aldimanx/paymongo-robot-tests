# üöÄ PayMongo Robot Tests

Automated end-to-end UI test suite for **PayMongo** built with Robot Framework and Playwright using the `robotframework-browser` library.

This project covers key regression flows:

- ‚ùå  Sign Up (`/signup`) until SOA (Statement of Account) page  stuck with verification, dummy email cant receive otp
- ‚ùå  Log In (`/login`)  kept asking for verification OTP
- ‚ùå Account Activation Steps (1‚Äì5) need a lot to configured especially take photo and documentation
